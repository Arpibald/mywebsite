  	<b>About the game:</b>
  	This game is a dating simulator, where the story is not developed YET, we can just move with our character back and forward.  </font></div>
    <div align="center">
	&nbsp;</div>
  	I don't really want a main story in the game, but you can get to know the other characters in the game and their backstories.
  	The situation is simple, you're a boy who just moved into a dormitory from your city.  </font></div>
    <div align="center">
	&nbsp;</div>
  	There is no specific story line, so you can start the game however you want. I want the players to play the game in their own style.
  	The players choices will be balanced in karmapoints, that can affect outcomes on characters.  </font></div>

  	<b>About our team:</b>
  	This project was started at the end of 2019. 
  	I was alone but very shortly my friendly community joined to help me, and I made a translator team out of them.
  	They fix my misstypes and help me to translate texts. Even this text is getting translated by Bedelin a good friend of mine. (Hi there! :) )  </font></div>
    <div align="center">
	&nbsp;</div>
  	I made the drawings by myself but a friend of mine joined to help me. He's hand drawings are very good, and easy
  	to reproduce and digitize it, so they would came alive on our screens.  </font></div>
    <div align="center">
	&nbsp;</div>
  	Please keep that in mind, that the game doesn't have a main story, it is being developed as a dating simulator.  </font></div>
